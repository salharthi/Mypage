I am a Human-Computer Interaction researcher and a PhD Candidate at New Mexico State University. My research lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and Game Design. I investigate the ways people engage in social activities in physical, virtual, and mixed spaces, such as distributed multiplayer games, online learning environments, and disaster response training simulations. My work explores new approaches to support collective sensemaking, planning, team awareness, and communication in distributed environments. I incorporate fieldwork and observation to understand existing contexts and practices; design novel collaborative interfaces and game mechanics; and test these designs through mixed methods studies in the lab and in the field.

Research Interest: distributed collaboration, team awareness, mixed reality, game design, software learnability, learning systems, serious games, gamification, player/user experience, and wearable technology.
