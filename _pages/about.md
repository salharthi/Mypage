<p style="line-height:140%">I am a Human-Computer Interaction researcher and an Assistant Professor of Software Engineering at the University of Jeddah. My research lies at the intersection of HCI, CSCW, and Game Design. I investigate the ways people engage in social activities in physical, virtual, and mixed spaces, such as distributed multiplayer games, human-drone teams, online learning environments, and disaster response training simulations. My work explores new approaches to support collective sensemaking, planning, team awareness, and communication in distributed environments. I incorporate fieldwork and observation to understand existing contexts and practices; design novel collaboration interfaces and game mechanics; and test these designs through mixed methods studies in the lab and in the field.</p>
